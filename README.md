# JavaScript Learning Repository 🚀

Welcome to my daily JavaScript learning journey! This repository contains files and notes from my daily practice sessions as I enhance my JavaScript skills.

## Learning Approach 🤔

I believe in QDD (Question Driven Development) as my primary learning method. Unlike traditional tutorials, QDD involves actively seeking answers to questions that arise during the coding process. This approach not only helps me understand concepts more deeply but also enables me to break free from the "tutorial hell".

## Daily Files 📁

- [Day 1](day1.js): Introduction to variables and data types.
- [Day 2](day2.js): Exploring functions and control flow.

## Notes 📝

Feel free to browse through the files and notes. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

Happy coding! 💻🎉
